Project submitted for the Swift Student Challenge
 - For the application to work properly you need to emulate it on the iPhone 14 and keep the phone in portrait mode.

A little about me and the application

My name is Matheus and I am currently 18 years old. I am Brazilian and programming entered my life in an unexpected way. Although I have always liked technology, I used to play videogames just for fun. However, when the opportunity arose to take a technical course in systems development, I simply fell in love.
The freedom of code and the possibility to create applications and software to help people were the elements that enchanted me in this area.

My idea came from a personal experience: my grandmother was recently diagnosed with dementia, which greatly affected her memory. My dream is to evolve my technical skills to create an application that can help her in some way and repay all the love she has always given me.

Unfortunately Alzheimer's, one of the most common types of dementia, according to research directly affects face recognition.
So I thought of making a kind of face memory game, in which the user has a time to memorize a random face, being hair, eyes, nose and mouth the parts that he must memorize, and then try to assemble the face.
In a simple way this was the idea and exactly what I did, it was very simple, but I was satisfied with the result.

The images of the face and the parts of the face I drew myself and all the design itself I thought, I think that's why it was very simple, but I wanted to make the entire application alone, make me try harder, since I have a little more affection for this idea and this application.
