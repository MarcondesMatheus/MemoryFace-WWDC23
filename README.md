# Memory Face - Swift Student Challenge 2023 [Winner]

- Memory Face was my submitted project in the Swift Student Challenge 2023.
## Overview
- The initial idea came about due to the case of alzheimer's in my famillia and studies showing how this disease directly affects face recognition.

- The app is a face memory game, you need to memorize and then reproduce the face placing the hair, eyes, mouth and nose.
## More
- SwiftUI
- For the application to work properly you need to emulate it on the iPhone 14 and keep the phone in portrait mode.
